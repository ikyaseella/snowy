   <h2>Environmentally changing the World: What should we change?</h2>
   The term 'environment' has been difined by different scholars but the summary of all is that, environment is the sum total of conditions in which an organism has to survive or maintain its life process. It influences the growth and development of living forms.It is comprised of the interacting systems of physical, biological and cultural elements which are interlinked both individually and collectively.
<p>Our ecosystem is currently undergoing transformations that call for immediate attention. It is very clear that these alterations are not in any way helping in the preservation of our ecosystem but rather, the changes are gradually destroying the entirety of our ecosystem. Considering how essential the environment is to man’s well-being, it is important that we collectively devise means that could curtail the destructive changes the ecosystemem is undergoing.</p>
<p>So many factors influence these changes which can either be natural such as: earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, volcanic eruption etc. or human activities such as: mining, use of automobiles, burning of fossil fuels, bush burning, agriculture, logging etc.</p>
<p>Man’s activities since the inception of agriculture 11,000 years ago and subsequently industrialization has, greatly influenced the present state of our environment. These changes are brought about as a result of man’s quest for a better living and his effort to provide for the increasing population which has drastically distorted the nature of the ecosystem leading to environmental pollution, felling of trees, burning of bushes etc. Such activities to a great extent have negatively affected the biological diversity of our environment by causing mass species mortality, loss of habitat and spread of invasive species. In this situation the activities of man in the environment also has a great impact on man’s life. Such activities like mining, use of automobiles, disposal of wastes, logging, bush burning and several others industrial activities which lead to the release of hazardous waste into the environment negatively impacts man’s life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these activities result to environmental pollution that challenges man’s health and plants growth. According to world health organization (WHO), at least 92% of the world population is exposed to unsafe level of pollution. The purity of our environment has greatly reduced as a result of water, air and land pollution. The major causes of environmental pollutions are attributed to man’s activities ranging from industry to agriculture. Pollutants such as ammonia, carbon monoxides, carbon dioxides, chlorofluorocarbons and several greenhouse gasses have made the environment unsafe for every member of the ecosystem. These pollutants are capable of causing disease to man, plant and several animals often resulting to death. Also, such activities reduce the ability of plant to grow well and sequester carbon which exacerbates climate change. Air pollution has a major impact in the process of plants evolution by preventing photosynthesis in many cases which is one of the ways of purifying the air we breathe. Air pollution is the world’s leading environmental risk factor, it may play a role in the development of cardio-metabolic diseases such as diabetes. Environmental pollution contributes to roughly 9 million deaths worldwide every year. A study carried out by evidence action organization shows that, an estimated 480,000 children under the age of 5 die annually from diseases related to unsafe water. Sadly, 40% of deaths worldwide have been attributed to pollution which is largely a result of our activities in the environment.</p>
<br>
<p>What should we change?</p>
<p>Great damage has already been done, but what is the way forward? Most people are not aware of the resultant effect of their activities to the environment. So as individuals, group and the government educating the masses on the importance of being eco-friendly and how the negligence affects us negatively will go a long way to help in maintaining an environment that is pure and safe for every member of the ecosystem. Educating the masses can be done through the collective efforts of individuals, government and non-governmental agencies. They can enlighten the masses on the possible ways we can collectively help to save the ecosystem from destruction. This can be achieved through campaigns that will encourage planting of trees, stand against activities that will lead to deforestation and extinction of endangered species and several other activities that make the environment unsafe for any member of the ecosystem. Special attention needs to however be given to the vegetation surrounding us because it plays an indispensable role in sustaining other members of the ecosystem by purification of air through photosynthesis and being the major producers of the ecosystem where other members derive their food. We should not wait until our environment is totally destroyed by our hands before we know its importance to us</p>
<p>Enactment of laws that are against all forms of environmental pollution and any activity that leads to the destruction of the ecosystem. Every tier of government has a role to play in ensuring that every activity that exposes our environment to the hazards is tightly regulated. To do this, the government at all levels can set up agencies that will be given responsibility to ensure that the environment is void of any activity that can lead to destruction of any member of the ecosystem. Such bodies will regulate the disposal of industrial wastes and ensure that wastes from industries that are released into the environment are detoxicated . Bush burning which is a major threat to biological diversity should be prohibited and anyone caught in such act should be made to face the law as this has already caused a great level of destruction to most habitats. An alternative to the use of automobiles and many other industrial machines that release hazardous gases into the environment should be provided. Also, such a body will be able to regulate indiscriminate felling of trees and also control several other activities that lead to exploitation of endangered species as every species has a role to play in the ecosystem and should be protected.</p>
<p>Our environment is the only gift nature has given us in common and it is our collective responsibility to tend and preserve it. As Richard Rogers, an Italian-British architect once said, “The only way forward if we are going to improve the quality of the environment; is to get everybody involved.” Our environment plays a major role in our health and how we treat it has a great impact in our lives. So as faithful stewards of the planet we must unify and mobilize to halt the destruction of our priceless ecosystem.</p>
